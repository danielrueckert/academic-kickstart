The **Lab for AI in Medicine** at [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/) develops algorithms and models to improve medicine for patients and healthcare professionals.

Our aim is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques for the analysis and interpretation of biomedical data. The group focuses on pursuing blue-sky research, including:

- AI for the early detection, prediction and diagnosis of diseases
- AI for personalised interventions and therapies
- AI for the identification of new biomarkers and targets for therapy
- Safe, robust and interpretable AI approaches
- Privacy-preserving AI approaches

We have particularly strong interest in the application of imaging and computing technology to improve the understanding brain development (in-utero and ex-utero), to improve the diagnosis and stratification of patients with dementia, stroke and traumatic brain injury as well as for the comprehensive diagnosis and management of patients with cardiovascular disease and cancer.

**We are actively recruiting new members!**
